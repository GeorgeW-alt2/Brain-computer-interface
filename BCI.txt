# Adaptive Neurochemical Interface: A Novel Approach to Non-Invasive Brain-Computer Integration

## Abstract

We present an innovative brain-computer interface that utilizes a self-modulating neurochemical consumable, This system combines real-time electrochemical sensing with dynamic conductivity modulation through a consumable protein-polymer matrix. According to specification the device should demonstrate stable performance over 24-hour periods with automated metabolite detection and signal enhancement capabilities. Testing across 50 subjects requires consistent neural signal acquisition with minimal cross-talk and reduced noise artifacts.

## 1. Introduction

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have traditionally faced a fundamental trade-off between signal quality and invasiveness. While implanted electrodes provide excellent signal fidelity, their invasive nature limits widespread adoption. Conversely, non-invasive approaches suffer from poor signal quality and susceptibility to interference. This work presents a novel solution that bridges this gap through adaptive neurochemical sensing and dynamic signal enhancement.

### 1.1 Background

Contemporary BCI systems rely primarily on passive signal acquisition, whether through EEG, EMG, or other modalities. These approaches treat the skin-electrode interface as a static system, leading to suboptimal signal quality and reliability issues. Recent advances in synthetic biology and conductive polymers have opened new possibilities for active interface modulation, but integration challenges have prevented practical implementation.

### 1.2 Innovation Overview

Our system introduces three key innovations:
1. A consumable neurochemical interface (CNI) that actively responds to neurotransmitter metabolites
2. Dynamic conductivity modulation through protein-triggered ionic release
3. Integrated real-time signal processing with adaptive gain control
